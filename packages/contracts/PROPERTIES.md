| Property | Description | Type | Tested |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AP-01 | The collateral balance in the active pool is greater than or equal to its accounting number | High Level | ✅ |
| AP-02 | The eBTC debt accounting number in active pool is less than or equal to EBTC total supply | High Level | ✅ |
| AP-03 | The sum of eBTC debt accounting numbers in active pool & default pool is equal to eBTC total supply | High Level | ✅ |
| AP-04 | The total collateral in active pool should be equal to the sum of all individual CDP collateral | High Level | ✅ |
| AP-05 | The sum of debt accounting in active pool should be equal to sum of debt accounting of individual CDPs | High Level | ✅ |
| CDPM-01 | The count of active CDPs is equal to the SortedCdp list length | High Level | ✅ |
| CDPM-02 | The sum of active CDPs stake is equal to totalStakes | High Level | ✅ |
| CDPM-03 | The stFeePerUnit tracker for individual CDP is equal to or less than the global variable | High Level | ✅ |
| CSP-01 | The collateral balance in the collSurplus pool is greater than or equal to its accounting number | High Level | ✅ |
| SL-01 | The NICR ranking in the sorted list should follow descending order | High Level | ✅ |
| SL-02 | The the first(highest) ICR in the sorted list should bigger or equal to TCR | High Level | ✅ |
| P-01 | The dollar value of the locked stETH exceeds the dollar value of the issued eBTC | High-Level | TODO: check that this BREAKS in case of price change/rebase |
| P-02 | Any eBTC holder (whether or not they have an active CDP) may redeem their eBTC unless the system is in Recovery Mode | High Level |  |
| P-03 | After opening a CDP with some stETH, users may issue ("borrow") tokens such that the collateralization ratio of their CDP remains above 110% | Unit Tests |  |
| P-04 | Anyone with an Ethereum address can send or receive eBTC tokens, whether they have an open CDP or not | High-Level | TODO: use [crytic/properties](https://github.com/crytic/properties) |
| P-05 | eBTC tokens are burned upon repayment of a CDP's debt | State Transitions | TODO: check that eBTC.totalSupply() decreases after repayment |
| P-06 | The eBTC system regularly updates the stETH:BTC price via a decentralized data feed | Variable Transitions | |
| P-07 | When a CDP falls below a minimum collateralization ratio (MCR) of 110%, it is considered under-collateralized, and is vulnerable to liquidation. | State Transitions | TODO: check that liquidation only succeeds if MCR < 110% |
| P-08 | Any user can liquidate a CDP that does not have enough collateral | High-Level | TODO: check that liquidation always succeeds if MCR < 110% and the user's stETH balance is enough to cover the debt and the user has approved stETH |
| P-09 | As a reward for their service, the liquidator receives a percentage of the CDP's collateral, ranging from 3% to 10%. Additionally, the liquidator also receives a "Gas Stipend" of 0.2 stETH. | Unit Tests | |
| P-10 | A "Gas Stipend" of 0.2 stETH is previously deposited by the borrower as insurance against liquidation costs | Unit Tests | |
| P-11 | Anyone may call the public `liquidateCdps` and `batchLiquidateCdps` functions | Unit Tests | |
| P-12 | Mass liquidations functions cost 60-65k gas per CDP, thus the system can liquidate up to a maximum of 95-105 CDPs in a single transaction | Unit Tests | |
| P-13 | When a user redeems eBTC, it is exchanged for stETH, at face value (minus a redemption fee). | Unit Tests | |
| P-14 | When eBTC is redeemed for stETH, the system cancels the eBTC with debt from CDPs, and the stETH is drawn from their collateral | Unit Tests | |
| P-15 | A redemption sequence of n steps will fully redeem from up to n-1 CDPs, and, and partially redeems from up to 1 CDP, which is always the last CDP in the redemption sequence. | Unit Tests | TODO: check that if the system has at least 1 CDP, it may never go back to 0 CDPs |
| P-16 | Redemptions are disabled during the first 14 days of operation since deployment of the eBTC protocol | Valid States | |
| P-17 | Partially redeemed CDP is re-inserted into the sorted list of CDPs, and remains active, with reduced collateral and debt | Unit Tests | |
| P-18 | When a CDP is open, the total collateral is the sum of the collaterals split into the `CollSurplusPool`, the gas addresses, and ?? | Valid States | TODO: ask team about [Full redemption](./README.md#full-redemption) |
| P-19 | If an existing CDP's adjustment reduces its ICR, the transaction is only executed if the resulting TCR is above 125% | State Transitions | |
| P-20 | All fees generated by the core system are recieved at the `FeeRecipient` address | Unit Tests | |
| P-21 | No user holds any special privileges in or control over the system | Unit Tests | |
| P-22 | The `CdpManager` does not hold value (i.e. Ether / other tokens) | Valid States | TODO: this seems important and easy to implement, as an error can usually mean "leftovers" in position manager contracts |
| P-23 | The eBTC token contract implements the ERC20 fungible token standard in conjunction with EIP-2612 and a mechanism that blocks (accidental) transfers to contracts and addresses like address(0) that are not supposed to receive funds through direct transfers | Unit Tests | TODO: this can be partially & easily implemented with [crytic/properties](https://github.com/crytic/properties) |
| P-24 | eBTC tracks CDPs in ascending order of ICR | Variable Transitions | |
| P-25 | The ordering of CDPs is maintained as redistribution occur | Variable Transitions | |
| P-26 | A node inserted based on current ICR will maintain the correct position, relative to its peers, as liquidation gains accumulate, as long as its raw collateral and debt have not changed | Variable Transitions | |
| P-27 | Nodes also remain sorted as the stETH:BTC price varies, since price fluctuations change the collateral value of each CDP by the same proportion | Variable Transitions | |
| P-28 | Nodes need only be re-inserted to the sorted list upon a CDP operation - when the owner adds or removes collateral or debt to their position | Variable Transitions | |
| P-29 | stETH in the system lives in three Pools: the ActivePool, the DefaultPool and the StabilityPool. When an operation is made, stETH is transferred in one of three ways: From a user to a Pool, From a Pool to a user, and From one Pool to another Pool | Variable Transitions | |
| P-30 | Gas compensation per liquidated CDP is given by the formula: Full liquidation Gas compensation = max(1.03, min(ICR, 1.1)) + Gas Stipend, Partial liquidation Gas compensation = max(1.03, min(ICR, 1.1)) | Unit Tests | |
| P-31 | When a borrower closes their active CDP, the gas compensation is refunded: the amount of shares sent by the user are transferred back from the GasPool to the user. Note that these shares may represent a larger amount of stETH than before due to the accrued yield. | Unit Tests | |
| P-32 | When a CDP is liquidated, all of the collateral is transferred to the liquidator  | State Transitions | TODO: check balance before/after of liquidator |
| P-33 | Undercollateralized liquidations are also incentivized with the Gas Stipend | Unit Tests | TODO: check that P-32 holds even if ICR < 100% |
| P-34 | If the redemption causes a CDP's full debt to be cancelled, the CDP is then closed: Gas Stipend from the Liquidation Reserve becomes avaiable for the borrower to reclaim along of the CDP's Collateral Surplus. | Unit Tests | |
| P-35 | At all times, the total stETH balance of the system exceeds the deposits if there is no negative rebasing events | High Level | TODO: important and easy to implement |
| P-36 | At all times, the total debt is equal to the sum of all debts from all CDP | High Level | |
| P-37 | If the system is not in Recovery Mode (TCR is above Recovery Mode threshold), no user action alone can bring the system to recovery mode without an oracle price change | State Transitions | |
| P-38 | As a Individual Leveraged to the maximum (110 CR), I can only be liquidated if: The oracle price changes in such a way that my CR goes below 110 or Other depositors bring the system CR to 125 (edge of Recovery Mode), then the Oracle Price updates to a lower value, causing every CDP below RM to be liquidatable | State Transitions | |
| P-39 | Without a price change or a rebasing event, my position can never reduce in absolute value | State Transitions | |
| P-40 | A user can only be liquidated if there is a negative rebasing event or a price change that make the position go below the LT | State Transitions | |
| P-41 | Users can only open CDPs with healthy ICR | Unit Tests | |
| P-42 | Users must repay all debt to close a CDP | State Transitions | |
| P-43 | Each time I change my ICR, the TCR changes by an impact that is equal to the relative weight of collateral and debt from my position | State Transitions | |
| P-44 | At all times TCR = SUM(ICR) for all CDPs | High Level | |
